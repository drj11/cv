## Curriculum Vitae ##

David Jones

## Career Goal ##

I seek an advisory position in an organisation committed to
quality.

## Education and Qualifications ##

I was educated at the University of Cambridge, being awarded a BA in
Mathematics and a Postgraduate Diploma in Computer Science;
and at Aquinas College being awarded 5 A levels at grade A.  Details
are in the qualification.md file.

## Employment ##

My job titles ranged around Software Engineering at
ScraperWiki Limited, Ravenbrook Limited, Zoonami Limited,
Autonomy, Harlequin Limited, over a period of slightly more than
18 years.  Details are in a file I haven't made yet.

In 2010, I founded the non-profit Climate Code Foundation and
continue to be a director (which is a "zero hours" obligation).

## Skills ##

### Software Engineering (almost all aspects) ###

* Software Configuration Management
* Requirements Analysis
* Evolutionary Development
* Incremental Delivery
* Programming
* Design
* Software Correctness
* Planning
* Estimation
* Testing
* Reliability
* Documentation
* Bug Tracking
* Pair Programming
* Agile Devlopment

I tend to avoid buzzwords like MCSE
and PRINCE2 in favour of genuine competence and getting things
done correctly, on-time, and within-budget.

### Presentations and Communications ###

* Slide Presentations (using InkScape or similar)
* Oral Presentations
* Posters
* Napkin business planning.
* Technical Communication
* Written reports from 100 to 10,000 words.
* Blogging
* Tweeting

I am comfortable working alone or in collaboration.

### Training ###

I have experience developing and delivering training materials for
classrooms or workshops, mostly in the area of software development.
In particular I have helped deliver Python tutorials and held
workshops at PyCon UK; I have taught shell and Make for Software
Carpentry; I have developed a small CoffeeScript tutorial.


### Climate Science ###

Though not formally trained, my work on
ccc-gistemp has given me a good insight into the
epistemological basis of our understanding of surface
temperature change over the last 130 years ("it's gone up; and
it's our fault").

### Programming Languages ###

* Python
* CoffeeScript
* Shell (/bin/sh)
* C
* JavaScript (mostly Node.js runtime, but also browser)
* Lua
* are SQL and Regular Expressions programming languages?
* and many others too long to list.

Back in the day (1994 to 2003), I maintained world class
expertise on ISO Standard C and a deep section and sub-section
nargery.

### Software Tools ###

More than 20 years experience using Unix tools (the usual suspects: sh,
sed, awk, make, find, and so on). For version control (which
absolutely nobody should program without) I'm becoming a reluctant
advocate of git, whilst knowledge of perforce leaks slowly away. The
other VCSs I have learnt, hg, svn, cvs, I will not regret forgetting.
I am skilful in a variety of editors (`/usr/bin/vi` and `/bin/ed`).

### Miscellaneous Software Skills ###

All sorts of software skills like being able to write garbage
collectors, implement programming languages, program microcontrollers
(AVR, MSP430, PIC18F), calculate 3D collisions for rigid objects,
trace rays through 3D manifolds, create interactive web-based
programming environments.

Some knowledge of assembler and machine code for the
microcontrollers mentioned above, and also Motorola 68K, Zilog
Z80, SPARC, MIPS, Alpha, PowerPC.

## Hobbies and Other Interests ##

Rock Climbing (trad lead: VS, sport lead: grade 5) is my main hobby,
alongside occasionally other sports: horse-riding (hacking out, good
flatwork), badminton, squash, swimming, yoga.

I enjoy our garden and in 2014 I am pleased to have introduced two yew
trees, *Taxus baccata*, to our curtilage. The kitchen potager
grows, with *Sanguisorba minor* and *Achillea millefolium* being
recent additions.

I enjoy reading popular science, and occasionally pursue this
further through self-teaching from more serious texts (most recently
in genetics, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and plant physiology).
Sean Carroll's "Endless Forms Most Beautiful" was one of my
favourite reads of 2012 and provided an excellent overview of recent
developments in evolutionary development.  Beerling's "Emerald
Planet" is proving to be an outstanding read in 2013 and a nice
counterpoint to Endless Forms Most Beautiful, being a sort of
plant analogue.
