## Curriculum Vitae ##

David Jones

## Career Goal ##

I seek an advisory position in an organisation committed to
quality.

## Education and Qualifications ##

I was educated at the University of Cambridge, being awarded a BA in
Mathematics and a Postgraduate Diploma in Computer Science;
and at Aquinas College being awarded 5 A levels at grade A.  Details
are in the [qualification.md](qualification.md) file.

## Employment ##

I am a software engineer; I've had various job titles over a
period of more than 20 years:

- Scraperwiki Limited, First Engineer
- Ravenbrook Limited, Consultant
- Zoonami Limited, Senior Zoon
- Autonomy plc, Senior Engineer
- Harlequin Limited, Senior Engineer

Details are in [employment.md](employment.md) file.

In 2010, I founded the non-profit [Climate Code Foundation](http://climatecode.org) and
continue to be a director (which is a "zero hours" obligation).

## Skills ##

### Software Engineering (almost all aspects) ###

* Software Configuration Management
* Requirements Analysis
* Evolutionary Development
* Incremental Delivery
* Programming
* Design
* Software Correctness
* Planning
* Estimation
* Testing
* Reliability
* Documentation
* Bug Tracking
* Pair Programming
* Agile Development

I tend to avoid buzzwords like MCSE
and PRINCE2 in favour of genuine competence and getting things
done correctly, on-time, and within-budget.

### Presentations and Communications ###

* Slide Presentations (using InkScape or similar)
* Oral Presentations
* Posters
* Napkin business planning.
* Technical Communication
* Written reports from 100 to 10,000 words.
* Blogging
* Tweeting

I am comfortable working alone or in collaboration.

### Training ###

I have experience developing and delivering training materials for
classrooms or workshops, mostly in the area of software development.
In particular I have helped deliver Python tutorials and held
workshops at PyCon UK; I have taught `shell` and `Make` for Software
Carpentry; I have developed a small CoffeeScript tutorial.


### Climate Science ###

Though not formally trained, my work on
`ccc-gistemp` has given me a good insight into the
epistemological basis of our understanding of surface
temperature change over the last 130 years ("it's gone up; and
it's our fault").

### Programming Languages ###

* Python
* Go
* Shell (/bin/sh)
* CoffeeScript
* C
* JavaScript (mostly Node.js runtime, but also browser)
* Lua
* are SQL and Regular Expressions programming languages?
* smatterings of R, Java, Lisp, and many others too long to list.

Back in the day (1994 to 2003), I maintained world class
expertise on ISO Standard C and a deep section and sub-section
nargery.

### Software Tools ###

More than 20 years experience using Unix tools (the usual suspects:
`sh`, `sed`, `awk`, `make`, `find`, and so on). Nobody should program
without version control. I currently use, and reluctantly advocate,
`git`.  Knowledge of `perforce` leaks slowly away, but I will not
regret forgetting the other VCSs I have learnt: `hg`, `svn`, `cvs`.
I am skilful in a variety of editors (`/usr/bin/vi` and `/bin/ed`).

### Miscellaneous Software Skills ###

All sorts of software skills like being able to write garbage
collectors, implement programming languages, program microcontrollers
(AVR, MSP430, PIC18F), calculate 3D collisions for rigid objects,
trace rays through 3D manifolds, create interactive web-based
programming environments, I can even parse a FASTA file.

Some knowledge of assembler and machine code for the
microcontrollers mentioned above, and also Motorola 68K, Zilog
Z80, SPARC, MIPS, Alpha, PowerPC. I have written /bin/false in
64-bit Intel assembler and my version is 99% smaller.

## Hobbies and Other Interests ##

Rock Climbing (trad lead: VS, sport lead: grade 5) is my main hobby,
alongside occasionally other sports: horse-riding (hacking out, good
flatwork), badminton, squash, swimming, yoga.

I enjoy gardening and in 2014 I am pleased to have introduced two yew
trees, *Taxus baccata*, to our curtilage. The kitchen potager
grows, with *Sanguisorba minor* and *Achillea millefolium* being
recent additions.

I enjoy reading popular science, and occasionally pursue this
further through self-teaching from more serious texts (most recently
in genetics, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and plant physiology).
In 2014 I read Dawkin's "The Extended Phenotype" again, and I
think I understood it this time.
