## Curriculum Vitae ##

David Jones

## Career Goal ##

I seek an advisory position in an organisation committed to
quality.

## Education and Qualifications ##

I was educated at the University of Cambridge, being awarded a BA in
Mathematics and a Postgraduate Diploma in Computer Science;
and at Aquinas College being awarded 5 A levels at grade A.  Details
are in the online application.

## Employment ##

Software Engineering under a variety of job titles at
ScraperWiki Limited, Ravenbrook Limited, Zoonami Limited,
Autonomy, Harlequin Limited, over a period of slightly more than
18 years.  Details are in the online application.

In 2010 I founded the non-profit Climate Code Foundation and
continue to be a director.

## Skills ##

Software Engineering.  Almost all aspects: Software Configuration
Management, Requirements Analysis, Evolutionary Development,
Incremental Delivery, Programming, Design, Software Correctness,
Planning, Estimation, Testing, Reliability, Documentation, Bug Tracking,
Pair Programming, Agile Devlopment.  I tend to avoid buzzwords like MCSE
and PRINCE2 in favour of actually being competent and getting things
done correctly, on-time, and within-budget.

Presentations. Slide Presentations (using InkScape or similar).
Oral Presentations.  Posters.  Napkin business planning.

Technical Communication.  Written reports from 100 to 10,000
words.  Works alone or in collaboration.

Training.  Developing and delivering training materials in
classroom or workshop format, and helping others to do so.
Mostly in the area of software development.

Blogging.  Tweeting.

Climate Science.  No formal training, but actively working on
ccc-gistemp has given me a good insight into the
epistemological basis of our understanding of surface
temperature change over the last 130 years.

Programming Languages.  Python, CoffeeScript, C, Lua,
JavaScript, SQL, and many others too long to list.  Would
previously have claimed world class expertise on ISO Standard C
here, but no-one cares any more.

All sort of strange software skills like being able to write
garbage collectors, implement programming languages, program
microcontrollers, calculate 3D collisions for rigid objects,
trace rays through 3D manifolds, create interactive web-based
programming environments.

## Hobbies and Other Interests ##

Rock Climbing (trad lead: VS, sport lead: grade 5), occasionally
other sports: horse-riding (hacking out, good flatwork),
badminton, squash, swimming, yoga.

I maintain a potted kitchen herb garden, and in 2012 enjoyed
successfully introducing chervil (Anthriscus cerefolium) to it,
which is hard to obtain in UK shops.

I enjoy reading popular science, and occasionally pursue this
further by self-teaching from more serious texts (most recently
in genetics, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and plant physiology).
Sean Carroll's "Endless Forms Most Beautiful" was one of my
favourite reads of 2012 and provided an excellent overview of recent
developments in evolutionary development.
