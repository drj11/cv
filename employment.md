## Employment

### First Engineer, ScraperWiki, 2011-11 to present

ScraperWiki is a small startup making a data-oriented web app. I
am the most senior software engineer, reporting to the senior
management team. The engineering team is sufficiently small that
we do not have an official reporting or management structure. Each
day the 2 to 5 people on the engineering team will agree and
direct the work. We all spend time planning, scheduling
resources, making build/buy decisions, designing software, documenting
software, implementing software, testing, deploying, maintaining. The
architecture of our product evolves by the consensus of the entire team.

ScraperWiki's current, browser-based, product is written in CoffeeScript
(which I was partly responsible for selecting) for both the front-
and back-ends, uses MongoDB as a persistent database store (hosted
via Saas).  It runs on Ubuntu servers running on Amazon Web Services.
We manage over DevOps by a mixture of direct manipulation of the
AWS interface (for example, for low frequency DNS changes), and
saltstack.

I frequently interact with our customer facing team to assess
the feasibility of building / buying various solutions, and in
helping building a more accurate picture of customer need. I
occasionally interact with customers direct (both concierge and
self-service) either in a support capacity or to again build a
more accurate picture of need.

Planning our engineering tasks is a weekly activity performed by
an appropriate selection of the engineering team and the senior
management team. I am usually present in the planning meetings,
and take an active role.


### Director, Climate Code Foundation, 2010-08 to present

Director of the non-profit Climate Code Foundation whose goal is
to promote public understanding of climate science. This is a
"zero hours" obligation.

This is a tiny startup with as yet no significant sources of
funding. We have done some small scale collaborations with
scientists from the University of Cambridge, and I have
administrated the foundation's participation in Google's Summer
of Code programmer where we have mentored 5 students in 2
separate years (I mentored 1 of those, and co-mentored them all
to some extent). We are currently collaborating with a european science
partner in a funding proposal. In 2013 we created the Science Code
Manifesto, sciencecodemanifesto.org, which has received over 1000
endorsements.

### Consultant, Ravenbrook Limited, 2003-02 to 2011-11

Consultant at a small software based consultancy with an office
in Cambridge, UK.

Ravenbrook itself provides consultancy on all
aspects of software, software engineering, and software
engineering management. I worked a variety of projects for
different clients, which included writing custom robot control
software in C, writing Windows GUIs for novel wireless networks,
moving an engineering team of more than 100 staff from PVCS to
Perforce, advising on how to write software and assess software
quality, implementing programming languages. Some of this work
was in collaboration with other Ravenbrook staff (who might be
managing a project for example), other work was led entirely by
me from finding it to finishing it.

### Senior Zoon, Zoonami Limited, 1999-11 to 2003-02

Zoonami was a small video games development company, working on
a leading brand console.

One of a tiny team of software developers working on a console
game and a variety of prototype games for a then bleeding edge
video games console. In such a small team it's difficult to
avoid doing a bit of everything, but I was responsible for 3D
physics, 3D audio, input processing (from game controllers), and
game scripting using the Lua programming language. And a little
bit of game design.

### Senior Engineer, Autonomy, 1999-09 to 1999-11

One of the two engineers responsible for the core text analysis
and information retrieval engine which was written in C.

### Software Engineer, Harlequin Limited, 1995-10 to 1999-06

C programmer in the (very small) Memory Management Group.

The Memory Management Group wrote a framework, in C, that
provided flexible and adaptable runtime memory management
services. It was used as the garbage collector for Harlequin's
Dylan commpiler and language runtime, and as the manual memory
allocator for Harlequin's Postscript language compatible RIP (a
product for printing Postscript to high-end printers). I was
responsible for almost all of the implementation and
collaborated in the design and testing. The C code was extremely
portable (typically it took half a day to produce an initial port to a
new CPU architecture, operating system, or compiler toolchain;
this in an environment where a portable garbage collector was
almost unheard of), and extremely reliable. Measured across
thousands of installed instances, the mean time between failure
was in the order of millions of hours.
